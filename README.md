# TulaBlue-Labeling-Tool
Freelance project for Tula Blue Events, a mobile massage clinic opperating in Maryville and Knoxville, TN. 

### The Problem
Tedious manual assessment of intake forms.
The scheduling tool used by Tula Blue does not have the ability to automatically label clients based on responses to their health intake form. In order to label clients appropriately, the owner of the business would manually click through each client on the schedule, review their intake form, and label those with conditions the massage therapist should be aware of. This was tedious and time consuming. 

### My Solution
I created a tool in colab that accepts a CSV of the schedule and outputs a table of all the clients requiring additional labeling. This drastically reduces the amount of time spent labeling since now tula blue staff no longer need to review intake forms and can navigate straight to the clients requiring labeling, which tends to be a very small percent of clients.
